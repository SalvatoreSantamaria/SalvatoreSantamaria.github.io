# Friendly Dog Viewer

This full responsive and mobile project was built with vanilla JavaScript and bootstrap, with the goal of populating images from the external https://dog.ceo/api. 
On page load, the page populates with random images of different dog breeds with the dog names displaying. 
Users have the option of selecting from a few popular breeds in the navbar. 

Note: This API does not return a standard image siz, thus some pictures are cutoff, due to the project requirement that the all images populate 50% of the screen.
