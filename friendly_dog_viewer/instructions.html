Code challenge
We want you to build a page with a responsive menu with 6 menu items in CSS and HTML. Create a github repository and use github pages to show us your work.

For larger screens, the menu should be 
<!-- horizontal,  -->
<!-- fully-visible and  -->
<!-- centered on the page with centered text and  -->
<!-- a maximum width of 1200 pixels. 
The page content should show below the menu and be centered with additional margin or padding. -->


<!-- For small screens, the menu should be a collapsible vertical menu 
with left-aligned menu item text. 
The page content should be below the menu. The menu and content should fill the entire width of the screen. -->

<!-- When you click on the a menu item, it should show three dogs along with their corresponding breed. -->
<!-- Use the Dog API to find images and breed info (you should be able to tell the breed from the file path). -->

The dog image on the left should take up 50% of the container and the breed text on the right should take up half the container and be centered vertically and horizontally. 

The height of the container can match the height of the image. Normalize the image dimensions for each dog if you want extra points.

<!-- Image

Bonus
Use JavaScript to show or hide the breed text with a query string paramenter. -->

<!-- Bonus++
Populate the dog images and breed by hitting the Dog API when the page loads. -->

<!-- Use whatever frameworks you want if it makes your life easier, as long as you can talk through what’s going on with the code. Also, we aren’t trying for any gotchas or testing your ability to read our minds. Use your best judgement and have some fun. -->
